# Supplementary Numerical Material

This repository contains supplementary numerical material associated with the paper

> **An Iterative LMI-Based Approach for Reduced-Order \(\mathcal{H}_{\infty}\) Filtering of Discrete-Time Hidden Markov Jump Linear Systems**

accepted for publication in *IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)*.

## Purpose of the Repository

The material provided here is intended to complement the numerical discussion presented in the paper, with a particular focus on illustrating the sensitivity of the proposed iterative algorithm with respect to the scalar parameters \(\beta\) and \(\delta\).

In the manuscript, this sensitivity is discussed at a qualitative level due to space limitations inherent to the letter format. The present repository provides additional numerical data and scripts that may be of interest to readers seeking further empirical insight. The content of this repository is **not required** to understand, reproduce, or validate the theoretical results of the paper.

## Contents

The repository includes:
- Scripts used to generate additional numerical experiments with varying values of \(\beta\) and \(\delta\);
- Data files summarizing the observed convergence behavior (e.g., number of iterations);
- Optional scripts for post-processing and visualization of the results.

A brief description of each file and its usage is provided within the corresponding directories.

## Scope and Limitations

The numerical results provided here are illustrative in nature and are intended to complement the qualitative observations reported in the paper. They do not alter the theoretical developments, proofs, or guarantees established in the manuscript.

## Citation and Use
