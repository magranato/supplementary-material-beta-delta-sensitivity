# Supplementary Numerical Material

This repository contains supplementary numerical material associated with the paper

> **An Iterative LMI-Based Approach for Reduced-Order $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$ Filtering of Discrete-Time Hidden Markov Jump Linear Systems**

accepted for publication in *IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)*.

## Purpose of the Repository

The purpose of this repository is to provide extended numerical results that complement the numerical example presented in the paper. In particular, the supplementary material illustrates the sensitivity of the proposed iterative algorithm with respect to the scalar parameters $\beta$ and $\delta$.

Due to the space constraints inherent to the letter format, the manuscript discusses this aspect at a qualitative level. The material provided here is intended to offer additional empirical insight for interested readers and does not constitute an integral part of the published paper.

## Contents

The repository includes:
- A PDF document containing extended numerical results and additional simulations related to the numerical example presented in the paper.

The PDF can be viewed independently and does not require any additional files or software.

## Scope and Disclaimer

The supplementary numerical results are illustrative and exploratory in nature. They do not modify, extend, or replace the theoretical developments, proofs, or guarantees established in the manuscript. The conclusions of the paper remain fully supported by the material included in the published article.

## Citation
